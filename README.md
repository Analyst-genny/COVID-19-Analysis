This analysis uses an interactive dashboard built in Power BI to track and visualize key metrics related to the COVID-19 pandemic data gotten from Kaggle. The focus is on deaths, recoveries, confirmed cases, and their distribution across time (monthly, yearly, and quarterly) and geographies (countries).
The dashboard combines global totals for three years (2020, 2021, and 2022) while allowing country-specific insights through slicers, making it a comprehensive tool for analysis.
Key Metrics
1. Confirmed Cases : 119 billion
2. Recovered Cases: 23 billion
3. Deaths: 2 billion
These metrics are connected to the slicers for Country and Year, enabling detailed analysis for specific regions or time periods.
Observations
1. View Functionality
The dashboard presents global totals across three years (2020, 2021, and 2022) by default. Users can interact with the slicers for a more focused analysis:
Country Slicer: Filters the data to show metrics and trends for the selected country. This allows granular insights into a specific country’s confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
Year Slicer: Filters metrics to display yearly trends while retaining the global or country-specific perspective.
2. Key insights:
1. High Mortality in Certain Quarters (Quarter 2)
Quarter 2 stands out as having the highest death count, particularly in 2021. This suggests a potential seasonal or variant-driven surge in infections, contributing to increased mortality during these months. Further investigation into the specific causes, such as variants of concern, or healthcare system limitations during this period, would provide more clarity.
2. Yearly Trends of Confirmed Cases and Recoveries
Over the years (2020–2022), there is a consistent increase in confirmed cases globally. However, the recovery rate has also increased, especially in 2022, indicating more effective treatment protocols, vaccinations, and immunity over time. Despite this, the gap between confirmed cases and recoveries suggests that some cases are still being missed or underreported.

Death rates, while showing improvements in some regions (due to vaccinations or other interventions), remain significant in certain countries. This discrepancy warrants more localized healthcare interventions to reduce the mortality gap.
3. Country-Specific Disparities
The Country Slicer provides an insight into the wide disparity in how countries are handling the pandemic. Some countries have seen remarkable improvements in recovery rates, while others still struggle with high mortality. This could reflect differences in healthcare capacity, vaccination coverage, and government responses.
Notably, countries with lower vaccination rates seem to have higher death counts, while those with higher vaccination coverage show a significant decline in death rates. This reinforces the importance of vaccination campaigns and public health interventions.
4. Monthly Trends Show Seasonal Patterns
The Monthly Trend chart highlights fluctuations in case numbers, suggesting the presence of seasonal spikes (e.g., spikes in January, April, and November). These peaks could align with global lockdowns, holiday gatherings, or mutations in the virus, indicating that monitoring seasonal variations and preparing for these spikes could help reduce strain on healthcare systems.
5. Quarterly Death Distribution
The Quarterly Distribution of Deaths shows that Quarter 2 accounts for a significant proportion of the total deaths. This suggests that critical periods (e.g., spring or summer months) might be more dangerous, possibly due to healthcare system overload or delays in vaccination efforts during this period.
This information can be used to allocate resources more efficiently during peak times and to plan for seasonal healthcare challenges.
6. Rising Death Count in 2021 Compared to 2020
The Yearly Death Count chart indicates a spike in deaths during 2021, likely due to the emergence of new variants and the delayed global vaccine rollout in early 2021. This highlights the critical need for timely interventions, including rapid vaccine distribution and enhanced public health measures.
The higher death count in 2021 could also point to delays in public health response or inadequate medical care in certain regions, which should be a focus for future pandemic planning.
7. Confirmed Cases Continue to Rise
The total confirmed cases globally have continued to rise over the years, with 2022 showing a notable increase. This emphasizes the importance of sustained vigilance in preventing transmission, continuing public health measures, and maintaining high vaccination coverage to reduce the overall burden.
3. Correlations and Trends
Recovery and Confirmed Cases:
A positive correlation between confirmed and recovered cases suggests an effective global response over time.
However, recoveries lag significantly behind confirmed cases in absolute numbers.
Geographical Trends:
The country slicer connects to all charts and metrics, enabling tailored insights for specific regions. For example:
Some countries may exhibit higher recovery rates, while others may face challenges with higher mortality rates.
Yearly and Quarterly Distributions
Deaths are disproportionately high in certain quarters (e.g., Quarter 2), possibly indicating seasonal effects or pandemic waves.
Anomalies
Yearly Death Count:
The 2021 death count shows a significant spike compared to 2020, which may reflect the impact of new variants or delayed responses in certain regions.
Recovery Gaps:
While recovery numbers have improved, the gap between confirmed and recovered cases suggests unreported recoveries or unresolved cases.
Methods and Tools Used
1. Data Sourcing and Integration.
Data was collected from global COVID-19 repositories, processed, and visualized using Power BI.
2. Dashboard Features:
Slicers:
Country Slicer: Filters data across all metrics and visualizations to analyze regional trends.
Year Slicer: Provides insights into yearly trends for confirmed, recovered, and death metrics.
Visualizations:
Bar charts: Used for monthly and yearly trends.
Donut chart: Visualizes quarterly death distribution.
Cards: Summarize high-level metrics for quick insights.
Long-Term Recommendations:
•	Ongoing Vigilance: Given the ongoing nature of COVID-19, it is essential for healthcare systems and governments to maintain long-term preparedness for potential surges and the emergence of new variants.
•	Boost Public Health Campaigns: Public health campaigns should remain active, particularly for vaccination and mental health, to ensure individuals are informed and protected.
•	Prepare for Post-Pandemic Recovery: As the world gradually recovers, governments and organizations should focus on rebuilding economies, mental health support systems, and ensuring that healthcare infrastructure is sustainable for future crises.
